# Project Monkeypox Detection

## Overview
This repository is part of a collaborative project by Group 50 in 11-785 Introduction to Deep Learning at CMU-Africa. Our project aims to replicate and enhance the model described in the paper "Image Data Collection and Implementation of Deep Learning-Based Model in Detecting Monkeypox Disease Using Modified VGG16."

## Repository Structure
- `MAIN-PAPER-REVISED`: The original paper (Image Data Collection and Implementation of Deep Learning-Based Model in Detecting Monkeypox Disease Using Modified VGG16) we are building upon.
- `project-monkeypox-detection-amuhairw.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing all code for my first experiment to replicate the results reported in the paper for our project.

## Project Objective
We aim to replicate the study's findings and improve the diagnostic accuracy of the Modified VGG16 model used to detect Monkeypox from dermatological images. We aim to refine the model using advanced machine-learning techniques.

## Committing Experiments
This repository will also serve as a dynamic record of my experiments conducted for the project. I will regularly commit updates to my experiment notebooks here. This allows other group members to easily view progress and provides transparency in our collaboration process.

## Datasets
The project uses the "Monkeypox2022" dataset, which includes images sourced from public domains and online portals. This dataset is crucial for training our model to recognize and diagnose Monkeypox effectively.

## Models
We are exploring improvements to the VGG16 architecture by adjusting layers and training parameters to enhance feature extraction and increase diagnostic accuracy.
